Simple TCP Chat (Mattchat) Version 1.0.0 2/13/14
by Matt Almeida

Welcome to my first README file!  This is written for two programs, a
chatclient and chatserve to communicate over sockets using a TCP connection
on the same network host.  These programs are written for a Linux/Unix system
and I compiled them using GCC using the following commands:

gcc chatclient.c -o <your client name>
gcc chatserve.c -o <your server name>

Feel free to use any C language compiler you wish.  Once the programs are
compiled, open the chat server in an SSH (I use PuTTY) and then open the 
chat client in a separate window.  The client will ask for a username,
and once this is entered you may begin to chat away! Use the keyboard interrupt
in either program (ctrl-x, ctrl-c) to end the connection.

This program was written for my Intro to Networking class in the Spring of 
2013.  Tons of thanks to my professor, Stephen Redfield, for a great class
and Brian "Beej Jorgensen" Hall for writing Beej's Guide to Network Programming,
located at http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/output/html/singlepage/bgnet.html .

This is my first completed program to load onto Git, and this README comes 
a reasonable amount of time after it's completion.  Please feel free to contact
